He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow’s breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n\\uf64a\\nhimself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medi- cine.\\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.\\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual ge- ography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had\\n\\uf64b\\n\\uf644\\uf64c\\uf64b\\uf647', metadata={'source': './files/chapterOne.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio’d face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own. Down at street level an- other poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word IN- GSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the po- lice patrol, snooping into people’s windows. The patrols did\\n\\uf647\\n\\uf644\\uf64c\\uf64b\\uf647\\nnot matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.\\nBehind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vi- sion which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.\\nWinston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vis- tas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with card- board and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy', metadata={'source': './files/chapterOne.pdf'}),\n",

Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter- ing along with him.\\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enor- mous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and rugged- ly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was sel- dom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of fig-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n\\uf646\\nures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguish- able. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off complete- ly. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the win- ter that had just ended.', metadata={'source': './files/chapterOne.pdf'}),\n",

Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably—since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the nov- el-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was al- ways the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unortho-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n\\uf644\\uf646\\ndoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a pe- culiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.', metadata={'source': './files/chapterOne.pdf'})]"

       "  \"text\": \"Do you guys know about the Putnam? It's a math competition for undergraduate students. It's a 6 hour long test that just has 12 questions, broken up into two different 3 hour sessions. And each one of those questions is scored 1 to 10, so the highest possible score would be 120. And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking this thing each year are those who clearly are already pretty interested in math, the median score tends to be around 1 or 2. So it's a hard test. And on each one of those sections of 6 questions, the problems tend to get harder as you go from 1 to 6, although of course difficulty is in the eye of the beholder. But the thing about those 5s and 6s is that even though they're positioned as the hardest problems on a famously hard test, quite often these are the ones with the most elegant solutions available. Some subtle shift in perspective that transforms it from very challenging to doable. Here I'm going to share with you one problem that came up as the sixth question on one of these tests a while back. Those of you who follow the channel know that rather than just jumping straight to the solution, which in this case would be surprisingly short, when possible I like to take the time to walk you through how you might have stumbled across the solution yourself, where the insight comes from. That is, make a video more about the problem-solving process than about the problem used to exemplify it. So anyway, here's the question. If you choose four random points on a sphere and consider the tetrahedron with these points as its vertices, what is the probability that the center of the sphere is inside that tetrahedron? Go ahead, take a moment and kind of digest this question. You might start thinking about which of these tetrahedra contain the sphere's center, which ones don't, how you might systematically distinguish the two. And how do you even approach a problem like this, right? Where do you even start? Well, it's usually a good idea to think about simpler cases, so let's knock things down to two dimensions, where you'll choose three random points on a circle, and it's always helpful to name things, so let's call these guys p1, p2, and p3. The question is, what's the probability that the triangle formed by these points contains the center of the circle? I think you'll agree it's way easier to visualize now, but it's still a hard question. So again, you ask, is there a way to simplify what's going on, get ourselves to some kind of foothold that we can build up from? Well, maybe you imagine fixing p1 and p2 in place, and only letting that third point vary. And when you do this, and you play around with it in your mind, you might notice that there's a special region, a certain arc, where when p3 is in that arc, the triangle contains the center, otherwise not. Specifically, if you draw lines from p1 and p2 through the center, these lines divide up the circle into four different arcs, and if p3 happens to be in the one on the opposite side as p1 and p2, the triangle has the center. If it's in any of the other arcs, though, no luck. We're assuming here that all of the points of the circle are equally likely, so what is the probability that p3 lands in that arc? It's the length of that arc divided by the full circumference of the circle, the proportion of the circle that this arc makes up. So what is that proportion? Obviously that depends on where you put the first two points. If they're 90 degrees apart from each other, then the relevant arc is 1 quarter of the circle. But if those two points were farther apart, that proportion would be something closer to 1 half. And if they were really close together, that proportion gets closer to 0. So think about this for a moment. p1 and p2 are chosen randomly, with every point on the circle being equally likely. So what is the average size of this relevant arc? Maybe you imagine fixing p1 in place and just considering all the places that p2 might be. All of the possible angles between these two lines, every angle from 0 degrees up to 180 degrees, is equally likely. So every proportion between 0 and 0.5 is equally likely, and that means that the average proportion is 0.25. So if the average size of this arc is 1 quarter of the full circle, the average probability that the third point lands in it is 1 quarter, and that means that the overall probability that our triangle contains the center is 1 quarter. But can we extend this into the 3-dimensional case? If you imagine 3 out of those 4 points just being fixed in place, which points of the sphere can the 4th one be on so that the tetrahedron that they form contains the center of the sphere? Just like before, let's draw some lines from each of those fixed 3 points through the center of the sphere, and here it's also helpful if we draw some planes that are determined by any pair of these lines. Now what these planes do, you might notice, is divide the sphere into 8 different sections, each of which is a sort of spherical triangle. And our tetrahedron is only going to contain the center of the sphere if the 4th point is in the spherical triangle on the opposite side as the first 3. Now unlike the 2D case, it's pretty difficult to think about the average size of this section as we let the initial 3 points vary. Those of you with some multivariable calculus under your belt might think, let's just try a surface integral. And by all means, pull out some paper and give it a try. But it's not easy. And of course it should be difficult, I mean, this is the 6th problem on a putnam, what do you expect? And what do you even do with that? Well, one thing you can do is back up to the 2D case and contemplate if there is a different way to think about the same answer that we got. That answer, 1 4th, looks suspiciously clean, and raises the question of what that 4 represents. One of the main reasons I wanted to make a video about this particular problem is that what's about to happen carries with it a broader lesson for mathematical problem solving. Think about those two lines we drew for p1 and p2 through the origin. They made the problem a lot easier to think about. And in general, whenever you've added something to the problem setup that makes it conceptually easier, see if you can reframe the entire question in terms of those things you just added. In this case, rather than thinking about choosing three points randomly, start by saying choose two random lines that pass through the circle center. For each line, there's two possible points that it could correspond to, so just flip a coin for each one to choose which of the endpoints is going to be p1, and likewise for the other, which endpoint is going to be p2. Choosing a random line and flipping a coin like this is the same thing as choosing a random point on the circle, it just feels a little bit convoluted at first. But the reason for thinking about the random process this way is that things are actually about to become easier. We'll still think about that third point p3 as just being a random point on the circle, but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin flips. Because you see, once the two lines and that third point are set in stone, there's only four possibilities for where p1 and p2 might end up based on those coin flips, each one being equally likely. But one and only one of those four outcomes leaves p1 and p2 on the opposite side of the circle as p3, with the triangle that they form containing the center. So no matter where those two lines end up and where that p3 ends up, it's always a 1 4th chance that the coin flips leave us with a triangle containing the center. Now that's very subtle. Just by reframing how we think about the random process for choosing points, the answer 1 quarter popped out in a very different way from how it did before. And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly up into three dimensions. Again, instead of starting off by picking four random points, imagine choosing three random lines through the center of the sphere, and then some random point for p4. That first line passes through the sphere at two points, so flip a coin to decide which of those two points is going to be p1. Likewise, for each of the other lines, flip a coin to decide where p2 and p3 end up. Now there's eight equally likely outcomes of those coin flips, but one and only one of them is going to place p1, p2, and p3 on the opposite side of the center as p4. So one and only one of these eight equally likely outcomes gives us a tetrahedron that contains the center. Again, it's kind of subtle how that pops out to us, but isn't that elegant? This is a valid solution to the problem, but admittedly the way I've stated it so far rests on some visual intuition. If you're curious about how you might write it up in a way that doesn't rely on visual intuition, I've left a link in the description to one such write-up in the language of linear algebra if you're curious. And this is pretty common in math, where having the key insight and understanding is one thing, but having the relevant background to articulate that understanding more formally is almost a separate muscle entirely, one that undergraduate math students spend most of their time building up. But the main takeaway here is not the solution itself, but how you might find that key insight if it was put in front of you and you were just left to solve it. Namely, just keep asking simpler versions of the question until you can get some kind of foothold, and then when you do, if there's any kind of added construct that proves to be useful, see if you can reframe the whole question around that new construct. To close things off here, I've got another probability puzzle, one that comes from this video's sponsor, Brilliant.org. Suppose you have 8 students sitting in a circle taking the Putnam. It's a hard test, so each student tries to cheat off of his neighbor, choosing randomly which neighbor to cheat from. Circle all of the students that don't have someone cheating off of their test. What is the expected number of such circled students?\"\n",

      "### Investment Analysis\n",
      "1. **Growth Potential:** Cloudflare has shown strong revenue growth of 30% year-over-year, indicating a robust demand for its services. However, it is currently operating at a loss, which is a concern for potential investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Valuation Concerns:** The high forward P/E ratio of 93.46 suggests that the stock may be overvalued relative to its earnings potential. The price-to-sales ratio of 18.06 is also quite high, indicating that investors are paying a premium for each dollar of revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Market Sentiment:** The analyst ratings are generally positive, with a significant number of \"Buy\" and \"Strong Buy\" recommendations. The target price of $92.52 suggests potential upside from the current price.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Volatility:** The stock has experienced significant price fluctuations, with a 52-week range from $53.88 to $116. This volatility may present both risks and opportunities for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Financial Health:** The company is currently not profitable, with negative net income and EBITDA. Investors should consider the sustainability of its business model and whether it can achieve profitability in the near future.\n",

This volatility may present both risks and opportunities for investors.\\n\\n5. **Financial Health:** The company is currently not profitable, with negative net income and EBITDA. Investors should consider the sustainability of its business model and whether it can achieve profitability in the near future.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nCloudflare presents a mixed investment opportunity. While it has strong growth potential and positive analyst sentiment, the current lack of profitability and high valuation ratios may deter conservative investors. It may be more suitable for those willing to take on higher risk for potential future rewards.'}"
